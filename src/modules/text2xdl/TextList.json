The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 h, and filtrated through diatomaceous earth (Celite®). The filter cake was washed with ethyl acetate (20 mL × 2). The combined filtrate was concentrated under vacuum, and then saturated aqueous extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, decolorized with activated charcoal (0.5 g), and concentrated. The residue was purified by chromatography on silica gel eluting with petroleum ether (PE)-ethyl acetate (EA) (10:1–2:1) to give a light-yellow solid (1.38 g, yield 55%)."
